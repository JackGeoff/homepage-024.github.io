				 <h1> About Me:	<h2>I'm a website designer</h2> </h1>

				 <p style="font-size: 30;" >

Meet Geoff, a talented web designer hailing from Kenya with a passion for creating visually stunning and unique websites. With a knack for both software development and graphic design, seamlessly blending artistic flair with technical prowess. My commitment to originality shines through as I proudly declare, "No templates here!" My expertise lies not only in crafting aesthetically pleasing interfaces but also in the intricacies of back-end software development. As a Kenyan software developer who challenges the status quo, I bring a fresh perspective to the world of web design, proving that innovation and individuality can coexist in the digital realm.
